        <h2>The WebAssembly Front-End Framework</h2>
    </div>

<section>
    <h4>Current Features and Development Stage</h4>
    <p>As of August 20, 2022, Wafis supports several core features. These include the use of TSX components, building TypeScript components, custom tag rendering, and limited AssemblyScript functionality within the build project command. Despite its nascent stage, the framework shows promise with these operational features. However, developers should note that it is still in the early stages of development, and they may encounter incomplete features and areas under construction.</p>
    <h4>Planned Enhancements and Future Capabilities</h4>
    <p>Looking forward, the development roadmap for Wafis includes significant expansions. Future updates aim to incorporate C++ with Emscripten, a dependency package system based on Napa, and Rust integration using webpack for Rust WASM modules. Additional planned features include API services, enhanced CLI options (e.g., more sophisticated component creation commands), CSS encapsulation for individual components, a main configuration file for various project settings, and advanced testing capabilities with Cypress. The framework also aims to support data attributes, class extensions to custom tags, SCSS integration, and Angular-like directives.</p>

<section class="cli-commands">
    <div>
        <code>wafis new project --name my-project</code>
        <p>Creates a new Wafis project named 'my-project'.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <code>wafis build --release</code>
        <p>Builds your Wafis project for production, optimizing performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <code>wafis new component --name MyComponent</code>
        <p>Adds a new component named 'MyComponent' to your project.</p>
    </div>
</section>

    <h4>WebAssembly Integration and Future Directions</h4>
    <p>
        A key feature of Wafis is its ongoing integration of WebAssembly using multiple programming languages like C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript. Currently, the framework has successfully integrated AssemblyScript, and efforts are ongoing to enhance this integration in project builds. The planned integration of C++ through Emscripten will also include an automated installation feature for both Windows and Linux systems, which will simplify the inclusion of C++ dependencies into projects.

        In summary, Wafis represents a forward-thinking framework that combines the strengths of React TSX components and WebAssembly to offer robust web development capabilities. While still in pre-alpha, its development path is clearly laid out, promising a rich set of features that will empower developers to build advanced, efficient web applications.
